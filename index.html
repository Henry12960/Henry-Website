                <p>I started my career with php oddly enough, I really like this language even though I stopped. I developed about 12 scripts for the <b>poggit</b> platform where all are approved and verified by all moderators, and I am very happy to work with this language!</p>

                <p>I don't have words for this programming language, literally the best of all when it comes to scripting, I started with it after php building an internal server. I love so much it. I have medium and almost complete knowledge about javascript applied to html and also use it to develop Discord bots.</p>

                <p>After learning js and java I started my career in html and css, it took me five days to learn all html, ten more for css and six more to learn responsive design as you can see. When I came across the html and css Already loved it face and from there I began to love working with the front end.</p>
